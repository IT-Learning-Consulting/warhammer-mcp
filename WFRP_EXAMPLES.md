## Quest Creation Tool

### Before:
```
description: 'Create a new quest journal entry with AI-generated content based on natural language description'

questTitle: 'The title of the quest'
questDescription: 'Detailed description of what the quest should accomplish'
location: 'Where the quest takes place (optional)'
```

### After:

## Dice Roll Tool

### Before:
```
description: 'Request dice rolls from players with interactive buttons...'

rollType: 'Type of roll to request (ability, skill, save, attack, initiative, custom)'
enum: ['ability', 'skill', 'save', 'attack', 'initiative', 'custom']

rollTarget: 'Target for the roll - can be ability name (str, dex, con, int, wis, cha), 
skill name (perception, insight, stealth, etc.), or custom roll formula'

rollModifier: 'Optional modifier to add to the roll (e.g., "+2", "-1", "+1d4")'
```

### After:
```
description: 'Request dice rolls from players with interactive buttons. Creates roll buttons in 
Foundry chat that players can click. Supports both D&D 5e (d20 system) and WFRP 4e (d100 system). 
Examples: "Roll Weapon Skill for Hans" (WFRP), "Test Willpower against fear" (WFRP), 
"Roll stealth for Clark" (D&D), "Make a perception check" (D&D)...'

rollType: 'Type of roll to request. D&D: ability, skill, save, attack, initiative. 
WFRP: characteristic (for WS/BS/S/T/I/Ag/Dex/Int/WP/Fel tests), skill (for WFRP skills like 
Melee/Ranged/Channelling), custom'
enum: ['ability', 'characteristic', 'skill', 'save', 'attack', 'initiative', 'custom']

rollTarget: 'Target for the roll. D&D: ability name (str, dex, con, int, wis, cha), 
skill name (perception, insight, stealth, etc.). WFRP: characteristic code (ws, bs, s, t, i, ag, 
dex, int, wp, fel) or skill name (melee, ranged, channelling, charm, etc.), or custom roll formula 
(e.g., "1d100<=50")'

rollModifier: 'Optional modifier to add to the roll. D&D: "+2", "-1", "+1d4". 
WFRP: "+10", "-20" (modifies target number for d100 rolls)'

- Clear examples showing d100 rolls for WFRP
- Explains how modifiers work differently in each system

scene_name: 'Short, creative name for the Foundry scene (e.g., "Harbor District", "Moonlit Tavern", 
"Crystal Caverns", "Altdorf Market"). Be creative and evocative!'
```

### After:

responses accordingly.'
```

**Impact:** Makes it clear that Claude can detect which system is being used and adapt.

## Key Improvements Summary

1. **Concrete Examples**: Every tool now has WFRP-specific examples
2. **System-Specific Guidance**: Prompts explain what works well for each system
3. **WFRP Terminology**: Uses authentic WFRP terms (Reikland, Altdorf, Chaos, Skaven, etc.)
4. **Dual-System Clarity**: Always shows both D&D and WFRP usage side-by-side
5. **Atmospheric Guidance**: Helps users create appropriate content for the "grim & perilous" WFRP setting

## Usage Pattern Changes

### Before (Generic):
```
User: "Create a quest about investigating a cult"
Claude: Uses generic fantasy tropes
```

### After (System-Aware):
```
User: "Create a quest about investigating a cult"
Claude: Detects WFRP system, uses:
- Cult of the Purple Hand or other Chaos references
- Old World locations (Ubersreik, Altdorf)
- Appropriate tone (grim, perilous, morally grey)
- WFRP-specific rewards and consequences
```

The enhancements make Claude much more immersive and accurate when working with WFRP campaigns!
