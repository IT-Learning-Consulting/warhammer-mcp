**Success Criteria**: ✅ Clear error message returned

---

### Tool: `foundry-update-character-info`

**Purpose**: Update character characteristics, wounds, and basic stats **DIRECTLY** (without XP costs).

**⚡ BOTH TOOLS COEXIST**: This tool and `advance-characteristic` both exist and serve different purposes:
- **`foundry-update-character-info`**: "Update WP to 40" → Sets initial value to 40 (0 XP)
- **`advance-characteristic`**: "Advance WP by 10" → Adds 10 advances (costs XP)

**When to Use This Tool**:
- Character creation: Setting starting characteristics
- GM adjustments: Story-driven changes (mutations, blessings, curses)
- Corrections: Fixing errors in character sheets
- Trigger phrases: "update to", "set to", "change to"

This tool updates the following WFRP4e data:
- **Characteristics**: Sets the `initial` value (base stat before advances), not the `advances` value
- **Status Values**: Current wounds, fortune, fate, resilience, resolve
- **Does NOT** spend XP or add advances - it directly modifies the base values

#### Test Case 1.3: Update Single Characteristic (Direct Set)
```
Prompt: "Update Test Character's Strength to 40"
```
**Expected Result**:
- Tool used: `foundry-update-character-info`
- Confirmation message
- Strength characteristic **initial value** updated to 40
- Characteristic advances remain unchanged (0)
- Total Strength: 40 (initial 40 + advances 0)
- XP unchanged (no cost)
- Verify in Foundry VTT character sheet

**Success Criteria**: ✅ Characteristic initial value = 40, advances = 0, XP unchanged

**Technical Details**: Updates `system.characteristics.s.initial` (not `advances`)

---

#### Test Case 1.3b: Advance Characteristic (XP-Based)
```
Prompt: "Advance Test Character's Strength by 9 advances"
```
**Expected Result**:
- Tool used: `advance-characteristic`
- XP cost calculated (~765 XP total for 9 advances)
- If sufficient XP: XP deducted, advances increased by 9
- If insufficient XP: Error message about XP shortage
- Initial value unchanged
- Total Strength: initial + 9 advances

**Success Criteria**: ✅ Tool correctly uses XP-based advancement, not direct update

**Technical Details**: Updates `system.characteristics.s.advances` and spends XP

**Comparison**:
| Request | Tool | Initial | Advances | Total | XP Cost |
|---------|------|---------|----------|-------|---------|
| "Update Strength to 40" | update-character-info | 31→40 | 0→0 | 40 | 0 XP |
| "Advance Strength by 9" | advance-characteristic | 31→31 | 0→9 | 40 | ~765 XP |

---

#### Test Case 1.4: Update Multiple Stats
```
Prompt: "Update Test Character: set current wounds to 10, fortune to 2, fate to 1"

## 2. CAREER ADVANCEMENT TOOLS

### Tool: `advance-characteristic` (and related advancement tools)

**Purpose**: Handle career progression and experience spending (XP-based).

**⚡ BOTH TOOLS COEXIST**: This tool and `foundry-update-character-info` both exist and serve different purposes:
- **`advance-characteristic`**: "Advance WP by 10" → Adds 10 advances (costs XP)
- **`foundry-update-character-info`**: "Update WP to 40" → Sets initial value to 40 (0 XP)

**When to Use This Tool**:

1. Verify Test Character has at least one career item (e.g., "Soldier")
2. Ensure one career is marked with "Current" checkbox in Foundry VTT
3. OR use: `"Update Test Character's Soldier career, set system.current.value to true"`
4. Verify character has 200+ available XP
5. See `docs/TEST_2.4_SETUP_GUIDE.md` for detailed setup instructions

```
Prompt: "Change Test Character's career to Sergeant"
```

**Expected Result**:
- Current career (e.g., "Soldier") found and checked for completion status
- If current career is **complete**: 100 XP deducted
- If current career is **NOT complete**: 200 XP deducted
- New career "Sergeant" found in compendium and added to character

- New career marked as "current" (checkbox checked)
- XP deducted from available experience
- Confirmation message shows:
  - Previous career name and completion status

**Technical Details**:
- Uses `change-career` tool (not `foundry-update-character-info`)

## 📋 ACTUAL TEST RESULTS

### Test Case 1.1: Basic Character Retrieval

**Test ID**: 1.1  
**Test Name**: Basic Character Retrieval  
**Date Tested**: October 5, 2025  
**Tester**: Claude  
**Claude Desktop Version**: Claude Sonnet 4.5  
**Foundry VTT Version**: [Connected]  
**WFRP4e System Version**: WFRP4e-core  

**Status**: ❌ **FAIL**

**Results**:
Character information was partially retrieved. The tool returned:
- ✅ Character name: Test Character
- ✅ All 10 characteristics with values, advances, and bonuses
- ✅ Current wounds: 15/15
- ✅ Talents list (6 talents: Marksman, Doomed, Warrior Born, Suave, Strong Back, Savvy)
- ⚠️ Partial inventory (weapons, armor, money, clothing)
- ✅ Active conditions: Fatigued
- ❌ Skills list incomplete - only 2 skills returned (Dodge, Entertain) with no advances data shown
- ❌ Fortune and Fate points not returned

**Issues Found**:
1. **Missing Fortune/Fate Data**: Fortune and Fate points not returned in data structure
2. **Incomplete Skills List**: Only 2 skills returned (Dodge, Entertain) without advance values
   - For a WFRP4e Soldier career character, expected additional career skills like:
     - Melee (Basic)
     - Athletics
     - Endurance
     - Intimidate
     - Leadership
     - etc.
3. **Missing Skills Advances**: Skills returned don't show advances count

**Error Messages**: None

**Root Cause Analysis**:
The MCP tool `foundry-get-character-info` is not querying the complete character data structure from Foundry VTT. Possible causes:
1. Query may not be accessing `actor.system.skills` properly
2. Fortune/Fate might be in a different data path than expected
3. Skills array might be filtered incorrectly or have incorrect property access

**Priority**: 🔴 **HIGH** - Core functionality failure. Skills are fundamental to WFRP4e gameplay.

**Recommended Fix**:
1. Review `packages/mcp-server/src/tools/character.ts` - `handleGetCharacterInfo` method
2. Check data access paths:
   - Skills: `actor.system.skills` or `actor.items` (filter type='skill')
   - Fortune: `actor.system.status.fortune.value`
   - Fate: `actor.system.status.fate.value`
3. Ensure all skills are being iterated and advances are accessed correctly
4. Add logging to verify data structure being received from Foundry

**Next Steps**:
- [X] Investigate character.ts data extraction
- [X] Fix skills query to return all skills with advances
- [X] Add Fortune/Fate to response
- [ ] Rebuild MCP server (`npm run build` in packages/mcp-server)
- [ ] Restart MCP server
- [ ] Retest Test Case 1.1
- [ ] Update test status once fixed

**Fix Applied**: October 5, 2025 (Second Iteration)
- Modified `extractBasicInfo()` to include Fortune and Fate from `system.status.fortune` and `system.status.fate`
- Added Experience tracking (current, total, spent)
- Modified `extractStats()` to extract skills from items array (filter `type === 'skill'`) instead of non-existent `system.skills` object
- Modified `extractStats()` to extract talents from items array (filter `type === 'talent'`) instead of `system.talents`
- Fixed skills to include: characteristic, advances, total, and modifier
- Fixed talents to include: name, advances, tests, and description
- Modified `formatItems()` to exclude skills and talents (now in stats section)
- Increased items limit from 20 to 50 for better inventory visibility
- Added equipped/worn status to items

**Second Fix Applied**: October 5, 2025
- ✅ **Fixed Fortune/Fate Structure**: Changed from object with current/max to single numeric value (Fortune and Fate don't have separate max properties - they ARE the max values for Fortune/Resolve pools)
- ✅ **Added Resilience and Resolve**: New WFRP4e properties representing determination and personal drive
- ✅ **Added Corruption Tracking**: Displays current and max corruption points from `system.status.corruption`
- ✅ **Added Critical Wounds Tracking**: Filters items with `type === 'critical'` and displays count, location, severity, and descriptions
- ✅ **Fixed Money Display**: Properly filters `type === 'money'` items and displays only items with quantity > 0, using item name as currency name (e.g., "Gold Crown", "Silver Shilling", "Brass Penny")
- ✅ **Improved Data Accuracy**: All values now correctly extracted from WFRP4e data model structure verified in wfrp.js

**Data Structure Corrections Based on wfrp.js Analysis**:
```typescript
// Fortune/Fate - Single value, no max property
system.status.fortune.value  // e.g., 4
system.status.fate.value     // e.g., 4

// Resilience/Resolve - Single value
system.status.resilience.value  // e.g., 3
system.status.resolve.value     // e.g., 3

// Corruption - Has value and max
system.status.corruption.value  // Current corruption
system.status.corruption.max    // Maximum before mutation

// Critical Wounds - Items, not status property
items.filter(item => item.type === 'critical')

// Money - Items with coinValue
items.filter(item => item.type === 'money')
item.system.quantity.value  // Amount of this coin type
```
