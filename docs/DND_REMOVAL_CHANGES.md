## Date: October 3, 2025

### Overview
Successfully removed D&D references from documentation and tool descriptions while keeping all functional code intact. The codebase now focuses exclusively on WFRP 4e support.

## ‚úÖ Files Modified

### 1. **README.md**
**Changes Made:**
- **Line 7**: Changed "Supports both D&D 5e and WFRP 4e" ‚Üí "Built specifically for Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay 4th Edition (WFRP 4e)"
- **Line 9**: Removed "(D&D)" parenthetical, kept WFRP terminology
- **Line 15**: Removed "d20 for D&D" mention, kept "d100 for WFRP"

- **Line 32**: Changed "D&D 5e or WFRP 4e installed" ‚Üí "WFRP 4e installed"
- **Lines 96-104**: Removed entire "D&D 5e Examples:" section
- **Line 113**: Changed "Works with D&D 5e and WFRP 4e" ‚Üí "WFRP 4e Native Support"
- Updated feature list to focus on WFRP (30+ tools, d100 tests, characteristics)

**Impact:** Main documentation now clearly presents this as a WFRP 4e tool

---

### 2. **WFRP_EXAMPLES.md**
**Changes Made:**
- **Line 57**: Removed "Supports both D&D 5e (d20 system) and WFRP 4e" ‚Üí "Supports WFRP 4e d100 system"
- **Lines 59-67**: Removed D&D examples and enum values (ability, save, attack, initiative)
- **Lines 69-75**: Removed D&D roll target and modifier examples
- **Line 174**: Changed "(e.g., D&D 5e, WFRP 4e)" ‚Üí "(e.g., WFRP 4e)"

- **Lines 85-95**: Removed "D&D 5e" column from comparison table, converted to single-column WFRP feature summary
- Updated language from "dual-system support" to "WFRP 4e support"

**Impact:** Document now describes WFRP implementation without unnecessary D&D comparisons

---

### 4. **WFRP4E_SYSTEM_GUIDE.md**
**Changes Made:**
- **Line 8**: Removed "originally built for D&D 5e but has been fully enhanced" ‚Üí "built specifically for WFRP 4e"
- **Line 199**: Removed "D&D 5e: dnd5e" example line
- **Lines 210-218**: Removed entire "D&D 5e Character:" data structure example
- Updated system detection section to focus on WFRP only
- Simplified data structure examples to show only WFRP format

**Impact:** Technical guide now treats WFRP as the primary (and only) system

---

### 5. **packages/mcp-server/src/tools/actor-creation.ts**
**Changes Made:**
- **Line 28**: Removed "Supports both D&D 5e and WFRP 4e systems" from description
- **Line 36**: Changed pack ID example from `'D&D 5e: "dnd5e.monsters"; WFRP 4e: "wfrp4e.bestiary"'` ‚Üí `'e.g., "wfrp4e.bestiary", "wfrp4e-core.bestiary"'`

**Impact:** Tool help text now shows only WFRP examples

---

## üîí Files Intentionally Left Unchanged

### Functional Code (Kept for Compatibility/Functionality)

#### **packages/foundry-module/src/data-access.ts** (Lines 1561-1562)
```typescript
{ pattern: /^dnd5e\.monsters/, priority: 100 },           // Core D&D 5e monsters 
{ pattern: /^dnd5e\.actors/, priority: 95 },             // Core D&D 5e actors
```
**Why Kept:** 
- Compendium priority patterns for automatic pack ranking
- Won't match anything in WFRP worlds (harmless)
- Removing could break generic compendium search functionality
- System-agnostic architecture supports extensibility

---

#### **packages/mcp-server/src/comfyui-client.ts** (Line 414)
```typescript
const enhancedPrompt = `2d DnD battlemap of ${input.prompt}, top-down view, overhead perspective, aerial`;
```
**Why Kept:**
- "DnD battlemap" is an **AI style descriptor**, not a game system reference
- The AI model was trained on this specific keyword
- WFRP uses identical tactical battlemap style (top-down, grid-based)
- Changing it would reduce image generation quality

---

#### **LICENSE and installer/nsis/LICENSE.txt** (Lines 27, 29)
```
- **Source**: https://huggingface.co/AdamDooley/dnd-battlemaps-sdxl-1.0-mirror
- **Full License**: https://huggingface.co/AdamDooley/dnd-battlemaps-sdxl-1.0-mirror/blob/main/license.txt
```
**Why Kept:**
- Legal attribution for AI model used in map generation
- Model name contains "dnd" because it was trained on D&D-style battlemaps
- Visual output works perfectly for any tactical RPG including WFRP
- Cannot modify license attribution

---

#### **installer/nsis/foundry-mcp-server.nsi** (Lines 226-330)
Multiple references to downloading D&D Battlemaps checkpoint model
**Why Kept:**
- Installer code for ComfyUI map generation model
- Model creates tactical battlemaps usable for any RPG system
- "DnD" in filename is just the model's training dataset, not functionality
- Map generation works identically for WFRP combat scenes

---

## üìä Testing Results

---

## üéØ Impact Assessment

### User-Facing Changes
1. **Documentation Clarity**: Users now see WFRP 4e as the primary system
2. **Example Consistency**: All examples use WFRP terminology
3. **Reduced Confusion**: No more mixed D&D/WFRP references
4. **Clearer Purpose**: Tool clearly positioned as WFRP-focused

### Developer/Technical Impact
1. **Zero Breaking Changes**: All functional code remains intact
2. **Extensibility Preserved**: Generic patterns still support other systems
3. **Map Generation Unchanged**: AI model references kept for functionality
4. **Build Success**: No compilation errors or warnings

---

## üìù Recommendations for Future

### Next Steps
1. ‚úÖ **Documentation cleanup complete**
2. ‚úÖ **Tool descriptions updated**
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Optional**: Could add comments to `data-access.ts` explaining why D&D patterns are kept
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Optional**: Could create EXTENSIBILITY.md explaining how to add other game systems

### What NOT to Change
- ‚ùå Don't modify map generation prompts (AI model keyword)
- ‚ùå Don't remove compendium priority patterns (system compatibility)
- ‚ùå Don't alter LICENSE files (legal attribution)
- ‚ùå Don't modify installer model download code (required for feature)

## Summary

**Mission Accomplished!** üéâ

All user-facing documentation and tool descriptions now focus exclusively on WFRP 4e, removing potential confusion with D&D references. Functional code remains intact, ensuring:
- Map generation continues working
- Compendium search remains functional
- System extensibility preserved
- No breaking changes introduced

The tool is now clearly positioned as a **WFRP 4e-focused** MCP bridge while maintaining technical flexibility for potential future system support.
